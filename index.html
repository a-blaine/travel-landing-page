            <h3>Riga, the Paris of the Baltics</h3>
            <p>
              Riga, the capital city of Latvia, is a worthy comparison to Paris,
              with its vaulting spires, steeples, art nouveau architecture, wide
              squares and cobblestone street. The Old Town is a UNESCO world
              heritage site, where you can find stunning art deco structures.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ornate House of the Blackheads is Riga's most recognisable
              building, and the Three Brothers are the oldest medieval houses in
              the the city from the 15th century. Stroll along the old city
              walls, where you'll find the Swedish Gate leading to Jakob's
              Barracks. Just off bustling Livu Sq is the famous Cat House,
              created to spite members of the nearby Guild Hall, and the
              inspiration for many of the cat souvenirs here.
